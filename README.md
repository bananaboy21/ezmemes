# ezmemes

A wrapper in Python designed to give memes in a hassle-free way.
High-quality meme APIs aren't easy to find, so this will grab memes from Reddit through the Reddit API.

It can be used in both Sync (Requests) and Asnyc (Aiohttp).

## Getting Started

Run this on your command prompt:
`pip install git+https://github.com/bananaboy21/ezmemes`
(PyPi coming soon)

## Updating to new versions

Run this on your command prompt:
`pip install -U https://github.com/bananaboy21/ezmemes`

## Example Usage

```py
import ezmemes

memey_stuff_of_life = ezmemes.Client(is_async=True)

await memey_stuff_of_life.get_meme()
```

## Endpoints

`async def get_meme(self, limit=500, position=None)`
